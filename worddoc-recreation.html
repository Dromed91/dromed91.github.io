        <p>POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. — One lifeguard will sit perched on a tall wooden chair.<br> Two others, maintaining distance, will stand sentinel on the beach below.</p>
        <p>All three will wear scarflike masks and carry face shields and respirators equipped with new<br> HEPA filters.</p>
        <p>They will patrol a beach that a town engineer determined can hold precisely 197 groups in zones <br> roughly 18-feet square, allowing six feet of space in between.</p>
        <p>“We’re trying to make sure that we can safely open as much as possible, as quickly as possible,” <br> said Paul M. Kanitra, the mayor of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., about 70 miles south of New <br>York City. “And that we don’t misstep too early.”</p>
